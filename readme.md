# Here are the steps you should follow for running the server.

1. Have node.js installed.

2. Configure server's development environment. (using a terminal navigate into `/node-nosql` directory) and create a `.env` file with the following structure. Make sure you replace the `username` and `password` with proper values.

    ```
    MONGO_DB_USER=<username>
    MONGO_DB_PASS=<password>
    ```

3. Install all the package dependencies with `npm install`.

4. Feel free to start the backend in development mode by executing `npm run start-dev` and test the routes with postman.

Have fun!
